# binary_search_tree

In this Odin Project, we will build a balanced binary search tree. A BST is considered balanced when it's left and right branches have a difference of 1 or less nodes. More information can be found at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-balancing_binary_search_tree.

The #pretty_print method is provided by The Odin Project with credit to https://github.com/Drew-Goddyn/binary_search_tree. This method is a visualization of the tree and it's nodes.
